# [yettifinancial.info](https://yettifinancial.info)

The client requested an improved site from the current site (still can be viewed (here)[https://yettifinancial.com]). The site is dreadfully slow, has broken links, and a poor mobile version.

All of this was improved upon greatly.

## Netlify CMS

The client wanted a CMS to add events and questions to the FAQ by themselves.

I utilized open-source [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for the backend. Netlify CMS is really lightweight and easy to set up. It integrates easily with Netlify and Git Gateway, all for free. It was a breeze to work with and much preferrable to Wordpress for this use case.

This is what it looks like:

An important design feature for me was easily viewing the services and returning back to the homepage. Such smooth navigation made the website feel modern and app-like.

## Speed Test Improvements

I was very satisfied with the speed improvements using [Google Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). Note [yettifinancial.com](https://yettifinancial.com) still holds the initial site, as the client did not want to transition this new site to the .com yet.
